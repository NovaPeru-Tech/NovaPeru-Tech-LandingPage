  <h1>Privacy Policy — Veyra</h1>

  <p>At Veyra, we value and protect the privacy of all users — including administrators,
  caregivers, and family members of residents.</p>

  <p>Our platform is designed to handle sensitive medical and personal data with the highest
  standards of confidentiality and security.</p>

  <p>All data shared within Veyra — such as medical records, reports, or communication between
  families and care staff — is stored securely and accessed only by authorized personnel
  according to their roles.</p>

  <p>We use data encryption, secure authentication protocols, and role-based permissions to
  prevent unauthorized access or data loss.</p>

  <p>Veyra does not sell, share, or distribute any personal or medical information to third parties.
  Data is processed exclusively to improve the quality of care, optimize communication, and
  ensure operational efficiency within elderly care institutions.</p>

  <p>Users can request access, modification, or deletion of their personal information in
  accordance with applicable privacy laws and institutional policies.</p>

  <p>Our commitment is to maintain transparency, trust, and ethical data management in every
  interaction with our users.</p>
